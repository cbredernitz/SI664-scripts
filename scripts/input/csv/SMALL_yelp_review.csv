We knew it was going to be a busy night for the restaurant so we expected slow service.  We have come to blue lagoon many times before since it is one of the most decent chinese restaurants in the area: but tonight's experience made us decide not to come back ever again!Food: because it was mothers day, the restaurant made you to order from their ""special mothers day"" menu; which are all expensive set courses. So you stuck with ordering crabs and lobsters  ( min $250+ for 4 ppl ).Service: no service.  No tea, no water, took 20 mins to finally order the food. Waited 20+ mins for EACH dish to come out. Still no tea, no water. The food came out so slow we decided to get the last few dishes to go. When we asked for the bill we asked if we can get the regular dessert that came with the food; they never come. Although it did take the server less than one minute to get the bill!Aviod this place!!",4,1,1

We went expecting sub par food engorged in a world of burlesque dancers and got amazing food with a subtly intimate decor. Yes there are viewing windows were every twenty minutes or so a young woman in lingerie would come out and to things like sew and try on clothes. But that gets old after the first time you see it .What the true appeal to this place is the food, for an appetizer we had cracked pepper chicken wings that were full of flavor and the spice was not over powering. For dinner I had the beef braised ribs, and they were truly not what I expected. I figured they might have a bone, but no they were three little pieces of meat on top of mixture of squash and corn.At one point I actually had to ask the waitress what the hell I was eating because I had no idea that corn and squash were supposed to go together. But they pulled it off and I actually left full of a rather small a la cart portion. Its a little pricey, but nothing too over the top.All in all it was one of the better meals I've ever had and it was completely out of left field. I guess it doesn't hurt to have celebrity chef Kerry Simon at the helm of the menu.Bottom line go here because you have a touch of the perv in you, go again because you enjoy a great meal.",2,1,1

Finally she let me in upon showing the ticket on my app and getting really adamant to understand what the issue was. I really did not appreciate being treated like shit.

The meat is beyond compare- savory, flavorful and satisfying.  The sides are a little disappointing- the plantains are delicious, but the rice and vegetables I had weren't that great. The service was OK.  We all agreed that it wasn't as good as we hoped but that we felt it deserved another chance.One note: we tried to redeem a Restaurant.com certificate and the owner said they had stopped accepting them months ago.  She said she had asked Restaurant.com to take the offer down, and she refused to accept the certificate.  I called Restaurant.com and asked for a refund, and they would only let me exchange it for another restaurant.   I continued to check for a week or two afterwards and the offer remained up.  That was a few months ago, and looking at the website now, they still have the offer, but in a smaller amount.

I had had the same type of meal at LA Crawfish in Tomball, TX.   The Angry Crab, however, had a larger selection of fish and seafood as well as sauces and intensity of heat.   I had the shrimp with a potato and small ear of corn.  I got the Trifecta Sauce and the medium heat.  It was SO good!   The medium heat was pretty spicy, but once I got used to it, I loved it.If you are looking for your typical Louisiana crawfish or shrimp boil, this is not the place.  Their shellfish comes in a plastic bag with the sauce you pick.  You don't need to dip it in a remoulade sauce or cocktail sauce.  It comes ""swimming"" in the sauce you select.They have raw oysters, poor boys, gumbo and more.  The atmosphere is very relaxed.  You can't go wrong here!",7,1,4

My boyfriend Charles and I just drove 4.5 hours from California and it was 7:40pm and we were out-of-it and starving. We were going to take our food to-go as BFG closes at 8pm, but the owner Jin was soo nice and understanding, he still let us eat-in. I mean the hospitality was AMAZING...and so was the food! Chicken strips can be easy to dry out, if not done right, but man...whether it was fried or baked these strips were always moist and seasoned just right. My boyfriend loved the fried because he loves panko breaded chicken :)  The mac n cheese....ohhh gooey cheesy goodness. Actually baked in the oven.well, long story short, we were in town for less than 48 hours and we managed to come back and eat here twice! Thats how good it was. It was the best $6 meal I'd had for as far back as I can remember...The simplicity of the meals is what makes this place best...The chicken is really the star here. Plus, the portions are perfect.

We received a small plate containing 5 slices of a beet and a few dime sized slivers of endive. All this for the absurdly high price of $13. We voiced our discontent to our usually helpful waiter. The manager brought over another smaller plate containing more endive, but no beets.For our entrees my guest selected their Scottish salmon ($26) and I ordered a Pub Burger ($19).Instead of fries I asked for something not so greasy. The waiter suggested sliced tomatoes. Perfect. I ordered the burger cooked medium rare. I also asked that they serve the aioli on the side. I received the fries which were cold, instead of the tomatoes i ordered. Further, the burger was as cold as the fries and the aioli was absent. Since we had theater tickets in hand for a fast approaching curtain, I returned the dish.My guest is on a low fat diet. She asked the waiter to provide plain quinoa instead of creamy quinoa and plain brussels sprouts instead of them roasted in butter. The salmon was ordered ""medium"". The dish arrived with the salmon cooked rare and the sprouts cooked hard raw. We sent the dish back along with my burger.The manager appeared again to apologize and to present his business card so that he could ensure a better experience should we elect to return. Overall the service was reasonable. Our waiter never asked us if we would like another drink (beer and a cocktail), which were finished with our salad.They gave us our check for 2 drinks and the salad. Paid and departed for the theater.",2,0,0

It's harder to describe but trust, you will understand when you see. We ordered a variety of apps and sushi and it was all amazing. Not a big desert fan and I think there were four to choose on the menu but the waitress highly recommended so we split one. Very unique and as amazing as the rest of the meal. We were looking to get away from the Vegas strip pricing though and it was not cheap. Cheap can be a dirty word though and I am a believer you get what you pay for. We tipped well and it was about $180 for the two of us inc one bottle $7 sake. Ok, it could have been even worse on the strip, but the food could not have been better.

Our waiter write down regular mashed potatoes, but the kitchen apparently didn't read the order carefully. My husband broke out in a rash as soon as we got home. Thankfully, my husband's allergic reaction is limited to rashes only, but that is not the case for many people with food allergies.

AMF Chandler lanes is just about 10 minutes away and it is astonishing how much cheaper AMF is. Plus, AMF isn't always cosmic bowling with a ton of distractions so that has been great as well. Never coming back here. They are losing so much money from their greed. ---I am a really avid bowler so I thought it would be fun to come here on my birthday. I was wrong. I have never been to a place so anti-consumer as this one. Allow me to explain:I came here on Saturday, April 23rd with a group of 4 people. If you weren't aware, there was a large fire in the area that day. The fire was so big that it made national news. The police shut down Gilbert from Warner to Ray so we could not leave the bowling alley. This also meant that nobody could enter the bowling alley either. The place was pretty dead and our (extremely expensive) time was almost up on our lane. We wanted to get some more time on our lane so that we could at least bowl to kill time until they opened the road again. At this point, we have been giving this place a lot of money. We had purchased 3 pitchers of beer, 4 shots of tequila, and 2 glasses of wine and food. How much would you expect another hour of bowling to be if we were stuck there and they were not gaining any new customers? $15? $20? Free since it was my birthday and we couldn't leave? Wrong. They had the audacity to offer us 30 more minutes of bowling for $40. This is only for 4 people. That isn't even enough time for a full game. I have never heard of such insane prices in all of my years of bowling. They totally took advantage of the fact that we were stuck there. We had to actually negotiate with them to get them to bring that price down. Totally ridiculous. Not only that though, we had a lane open right next to us the whole night. There were a couple slow bowlers in the group so we kindly asked them to open that lane up as well. Nope. They wouldn't do it. It would have cost them nothing to open it up but they didn't do it anyway. I have never had that problem at AMF or any other bowling company when I have asked. Especially when the place was so dead. They had the opportunity to keep us there so that we keep buying drinks, but they were so greedy that they wouldn't do anything to help the customer out. It really seemed like they did not want us to be there. Really dumb move by them in the end though. I used to come to this alley all the time and they could have made so much more money off of me. Now I will gladly take my business to AMF from now on. AMF is much cheaper and they have better lanes anyway. The only reason I came here was because it was close to my house. If you are reading this, please consider going somewhere else. You will not have a good experience here. I have never had such a bad experience at a bowling alley, and they really made my birthday the exact opposite of fun.",0,0,0

The idea is to allow the puppies to play and interact with each other; however, before the class began, the owner took our dog, along with another puppy (about the same size dog) and, without explanation, kept both puppies on leashes, severely limiting their ability to play with the other dogs.  Note - neither our dog or the other showed any sign of being aggressive or too 'physical' - they were both showing normal if not subdued behavior for puppies.  What was most distressing was that, while he was limiting their ability to play, he actually dragged our dog (flipping him over a time or two against my puppy's will) while he was looking elsewhere at other dogs.  He kept the two dogs on leashes for the entire session so they barely had a chance to play without any explanation why.  What was particularly galling is, halfway through the session, he gave our dog back to us to keep with us (doing the same with the other puppy) while he and his staff sat on the floor in the middle of the room with all the other puppies and played\/interacted with them.  We were made to feel like our dog was abnormal or a problem - it was quite insulting.

My first 2 star review...I try to do give an honest and fair review based off of a couple of experiences...I've been to many Tropical Cafe Smoothies...this review is only in reference to this particular location...so each time that I went here, from entering to leaving has been nearly the same experience...I've gone here at different times of the day and each time, inside and outside the area looks pretty dirty. The neon lights weren't even on. You can see with my photo's that I've included...There's not 1 worker there that seems to like working there. Each time, while I'm in line, someone is talking about their personal life problems...In my opinion, it's ok to talk about whatever you want to talk about, when there's no customers around, but when there's customers. It's best to try to be as professional as you can. I get everyone gets a bad day every once in a while...I'm not knocking on the taste of my smoothie...because it's been consistent. I usually just get the Peanut Paradise with Whey protein........my location of preference would be either the one on Blue Diamond or the one on Las Vegas Blvd near the mall and Canes...It's weird how this location has pigeons, reminds me of the Bay Area, where I'm originally from, without that stank ocean smell........This location is in Summerlin... Summerlin I was told is like an upscale neighborhood vs North Las Vegas, Henderson and even Southern Highlands...just 2 stop lights up the street and the complex is completely clean. This location almost feels as if you're in North Las Vegas off Craig...but yeah, I also noticed there were a lot of low rating scores at this particular location...if you don't believe me.

I was excited to see there was a new location since I live in Old Town & all I had was one white coat that happened to have a few coffee spots on the right sleeve. For starters, they wouldn't accept the coupon I had been given from the Frank Lloyd location (even though it doesn't indicate 'Must be used at ___ location' anywhere on it. Then, when I went to pick it up yesterday, I checked the coffee spots & they were ALL still there - even though I asked the guy nicely upon drop off to please use the stickers to mark the spots. Apparently that didn't happen & the woman working told me & I quote ""...sometimes we just can't get coffee out.""  I'm sorry, but coffee is water-based & I didn't touch the spots with any product so to me that's a ludicrous response!  With her less than friendly attitude, she offered to re-do the jacket (with no guarantees of course). I went to pick it up again today (since I received an email indicating it was ready) and before she even looked, she being the same surly girl from the day before, she told me it might not even be ready yet.  Really?!? Thanks.  Thankfully it was ready & low & behold the 5 stickers I made her put on the jacket must have worked because the stains were magically gone!  I'm sorry, but I shouldn't have to work this hard to get a few tiny specs of coffee out of a white jacket!  If you value your time & sanity, you're better off driving the extra miles to the FLW location.",2,4,1

I didn't give Mamaoh the fifth star because there wasn't that spark. The panchan was good, but they had a slim selection of four items (kimchi, brocolli, daikon and spicy tofu skin).

They won't make it in this business when there are dental practices who care more about the patient than up charging and finding any way to make more money.

Therefore, it was with great anticipation that we went to this 2-story restaurant. The atmosphere was typical roadhouse with a lot of music-related posters displayed on the walls. For appetizers, we ordered the Crispy Shrimp and Gator as well as an order of onion rings. The Shrimp and Gator was very tasty with delicious sauces, but the portion seemed small for the price. The onion rings had a pool of grease in the basket, which was disgusting. My teenage son wouldn't even finish it.For the main course, we ordered Mississippi ribs, pulled pork and smoked chicken. Everything was nicely smoked, which is an absolute must for me. However, the ribs and pulled pork were rather dry, which made me think that they were sitting under a heat lamp rather than being grilled fresh. Needless to say, this was very disappointing. I'm glad we had the Groupon discount, since I would have hated paying full price. Lastly, the service was extremely mediocre! Our waitress never even asked if we wanted refills on our water or if everything was OK. Again, very appointing.

I walked in without an appointment and was seated immediately (I was worried about the wait time as it was a Saturday).

There are unlimited biscuits that you can eat during your dine in. They were freshly served as they are warm and soft. You can't eat too much as it is very oily, but nonetheless, still tasty.I ordered the Fire Grilled Lobster Shrimp and Salmon with broccoli and the roasted potatoes as sides. The shrimp was pretty good, very flavourful and the texture was fresh. But then everything else just kept going downhill. The broccoli was frozen broccoli, the roasted potatoes tasted like they were baked, put into the oven, frozen and rebaked and was put into the microwave. It was way too dry and tasted very starchy. It was also way too salty. The lobster tail was the end. It wasn't fresh as the meat was kind of mushy in texture. As for the salmon, it was pretty dry. For something that the waitress recommended, I would've thought it would've been made better. We also ordered the four course meal that is only available from Mon-Thurs. You get to choose a soup, a salad, an entree, and a dessert for $22. We chose the clam chowder soup, Caesar salad, shrimp linguine and the brownie. Another set, we chose the chicken linguine. The soup and salad weren't bad, but the pasta was very mediocre. The brownie was also pretty good. However, what made this experience terrible was the server. Prior to us ordering, she was friendly and gave us recommendations since it was our first time here. After we ordered, she barely came to our table unless it was to give us the food. Often times we needed our water to be refilled, and she didn't bother to glance at our table. Near the end after our entree, she even asked us if we would like our desserts packed up to be taken out. We never told her to pack it for us. Not only was her attitude towards us very negative, she seemed to be opinionated towards our food choices and wanted us out asap. I won't reveal her name, but I definitely won't be back. In terms of food and service, I've definitely experienced better.",1,0,0

This is an experience I must share.We were seated quite quickly given that it was on a long weekend. I wanted to try the monster or pig egg yolk steamed buns. When I asked the staff if they had the buns, she said yes. After being seated, we were left to order on the menu sheets. We also asked for Tie Guan Yin (a kind of tea). We waited for a long time for someone to come by and collect our sheet, but nobody came, so we had to hand it into the person inputting the orders on the computer. The buns were not on the menu, so after we handed the sheet in, we put in an order for the pig buns because when I asked the waitress, she said they were sold out of the monster ones, but still had the pig ones. She even went to go check and came back to tell me that. We were given a receipt of all the food items we ordered on a receipt that was typed up. The pig buns were a separate receipt that was taped to our menu sheet. Many of our dishes came in a timely fashion. We ordered about 6 dishes and finished them all. Also, to add in, they never cleared the finished dishes. The empty plates and steamers kept piling up on our table. It was also odd that our pig buns still hadn't arrived. It was 50 minutes since we ordered them. We went to ask the person outside (since not a single staff member was around to serve our table). Suddenly another staff member comes and just puts the bill on our table even though we A) didn't ask for the bill B) just asked about our missing pig bun. He answered us by swishing his arm to us and left. A female staff member came to our table telling us that they had sold out of the egg yolk buns. She even accused us of having it on our menu sheet when it was their staff that input the order onto the computer to print the receipt out. They didn't even apologize for their lack of knowledge and miscommunication between their staff. All she asked us was who was the waitress that told us that they still had pig buns. This was the worst service I have ever had. Although the food was mediocre and acceptable, their service was horrendous. The tea that we ordered also wasn't the best, it left a bitter aftertaste on your tongue.",3,0,0
